AIDS Perfect
The WLLT does not separate the clusters by default. Consider the case that two graphs have completely different initial labels.
This is not the case. 
Thus the original WLLT does separate the clusters perfectly since all representations of graphs in the same class have at least one common non-negative entry (with respect to the original labels). 
And all representations of graphs in different classes have no common non-negative entry at all.
The SVM accuracy of the similarity measure arising from the initial ground metric was 99.49 %.
Among other, this experiment verifed, that the implemented method can separate classes with respect to the defined graph representations and the WLLT.
It also verified, that the learning method does try to improve on this score, since a few experiments (with batch size in $\{5\%, 20\%\}$, pull factors in $\{0.1, 0.3\}$ and the push factor set to $0.1$) showed no significant degeneration of the resulting qualitiy measure for at least 100 learning epochs.
